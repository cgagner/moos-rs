# MOOS-IvP Labs
The [MIT 2.680 - Unmanned Marine Vehicle Autonomy, Sensing and Communications](https://oceanai.mit.edu/2.680/pmwiki/pmwiki.php)
course has a collection of labs that help to teach students to use MOOS
and IvP. My goal is to update the `moos-rs` library to allow writing the MOOS
application labs in Rust.
